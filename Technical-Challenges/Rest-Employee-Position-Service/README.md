[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://paypal.me/yonhbu?locale.x=es_XC)

In this repository we work with Spring Boot and with Spring Data. Using these two Spring modules, we will create a CRUD REST SERVICE using JPA and a database engine in H2 memory. Good programming practices are applied such as some Solid principles (Immutability and Clean Code), Design Patterns (Builder, Mvc), Unit Testing and Lombok functions.


**Technologies**

- Java - Spring Boot Framework
- Postman - Testing API
- H2 - Database
- JDK - Java 8
- Project Construction - Maven
- Core - Spring MVC
- Library - Spring Boot Actuator


**Starter Project Dependencies**

1. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
2. spring-boot-starter-web
3. jpa
4. junit

**Practical Exercise Employee**

Create a project in SpringBoot with an h2 database (in memory).
The project must have the following entities: Candidate, Employee, Position

the service must expose a Rest API that allows to do the following operations:
● Create Employee
● Update Employee
● Delete Employee
● List all employees (This Endpoint must allow filtering by position or name)
these parameters are optional, if you don't send any of these you must bring all
the employees.
● Return a list with all the positions, and within the positions all the employees
ordered by salary from highest to lowest.

**Expected response::**
