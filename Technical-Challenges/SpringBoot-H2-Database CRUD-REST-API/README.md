# CRUD REST with Spring Boot and JPA
 
In this repository we work with Spring Boot and with Spring Data. Using these two Spring modules, we will create a CRUD REST SERVICE using JPA and a database engine in H2 memory. Good programming practices are applied such as some Solid principles (Immutability and Clean Code), Design Patterns (Builder, Mvc), Unit Testing and Lombok functions.
